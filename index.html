        "My name is Bhavna Basenoo, I have a bachelor degree in Communication, Media and Journalism.
        I was fascinated by what i was doing
        and came upon that there is more to learn in this field.
        My passion about coding led me to the bootcamp at Le Wagon to
        be able to learn more and make a new professional start."
